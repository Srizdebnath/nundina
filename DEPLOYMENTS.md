# Official deployments

Registry of official NUNDINA program deployments (G14: published from day one).
Every row is verifiable independently: program ID on-cluster, dump-hash against
the recorded build hash, upgrade authority against the authority map (08 §8).

| Program | Cluster | Program ID | Slot | Deploy signature | Build SHA-256 | Upgrade authority |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| credit-gate v0.1.0 (P0 skeleton) | devnet | `7yREa5V3ttjmwQ5dDv1DhThBzywgE5knJJuEAxppQa9c` | 503888002 | `2rDLR9z1NDskQsBXMf1jejEKVrCZ5ch7TJRxNTbfL79mZsms5rzigAi6JX4m7PKFLPVYryREVw7Gvz311xKv32dR` | `6e8c50879a0151c313f33c31b79d0ef4f9a945200a08cbbd4985efd75eef0e21` | `BprmmqrzBADdQ2iKARtqcDndWV5k22aUGrkMKeySjKgp` (single key — P0 bootstrap; Squads 2-of-2 takes over at P1 per 08 §8) |

## Verification procedure

```bash
solana program show 7yREa5V3ttjmwQ5dDv1DhThBzywgE5knJJuEAxppQa9c -u devnet
solana program dump 7yREa5V3ttjmwQ5dDv1DhThBzywgE5knJJuEAxppQa9c /tmp/dump.so -u devnet
sha256sum /tmp/dump.so   # must equal the Build SHA-256 above
```

## Notes

- The P0 skeleton contains only the CG-P2 config anchor (initialize/update
  config). It carries **no gate entrypoint yet** — nothing consumes it; it
  proves the build–deploy–verify loop and pins the program ID early.
- The program keypair (`target/deploy/credit_gate-keypair.json`, gitignored)
  is the only way to redeploy at this fixed ID. Back it up before any
  `cargo clean`.
- Verifiable-build reproduction (deterministic SBF flags) lands with the P1
  CI pipeline; until then hashes are recorded from this machine's build.
